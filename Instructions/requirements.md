# Room and Desk Booking App Requirements Document

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** June 9, 2025

## 1. Project Overview

This document outlines the requirements for a technical solution to implement a room and desk booking application for BIG direkt gesund. The project aims to facilitate efficient space utilization within an Activity-Based Working (ABW) environment across two primary locations, Dortmund and Düsseldorf.

The goal is to provide employees with a user-friendly tool to reserve available desks and project rooms, optimizing the use of office space and supporting flexible working arrangements. The solution will be delivered as a managed Cloud Service (SaaS), with the vendor responsible for technical operations and maintenance.

**Target Users:**
*   Approximately 720 employees of BIG direkt gesund.
*   Distribution: approx. 660 in Dortmund, approx. 60 in Düsseldorf.

**Scope:**
*   Booking of approximately 720 desks.
*   Booking of approximately 55 project rooms (approx. 50 in Dortmund, 5 in Düsseldorf).
*   Coverage of both BIG direkt gesund locations: Dortmund and Düsseldorf.
*   Scalability to accommodate future increases in users and spaces.

**Key Timelines:**
*   Implementation Phase: October 1, 2025 – November 30, 2025
*   Service Start (Go-Live): December 1, 2025
*   Initial Contract Duration: 2 years, with option for two 1-year extensions
